    "In the last lesson you explored how for loops at counting loops that iterate over a certain sequence. The sequence can be a string of characters, a set of numbers and other things we'll learn about in this course. While loops are another kind of loop. Unlike for loops that have an ending, while loops are indefinite loops that continue on until a certain condition is met.\n",

    "## While Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic for with *while* loops is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while <condition>:\n",
    "    <body>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For loops are great when you know how many times you want to run the loop, but if you want to run a loop an unspecified number of times until something happens, while loops are the way to go. Once again, it is easier to understand while loops by experiencing them. Try the following exercises.\n",
